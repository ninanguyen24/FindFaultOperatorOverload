# FindFaultOperatorOverload

Version: 1

Description:
This program will demostate the use of Operator Overload to add and compare to objects. Test arrays of size 5 were
created to test the operators. Users won't be asked to enter any input so there should be no
errors handling. FindFault holds 5 EncryptWord object in it's collection so when you compare the two FindFault objects,
each index of the FindFault objects would be compared to each other.
For example, FindFault_1[0] will be compared to FindFault_2[0] and so on. Assuming that FindFault_1[0] will not be compared
out of index like FindFault_2[2];

FindFault and Encryptword can be found in the other repositories.
